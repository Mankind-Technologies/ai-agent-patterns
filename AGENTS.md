## Goal of the repo

Store, explain and study different useful AI agent patterns. This includes patterns of agents collaborating with agents, agents using tools, humans interacting with agents, and other interactions.

`src/patterns/{pattern}/{lib-name}` directory with a pattern exemplified for a library
