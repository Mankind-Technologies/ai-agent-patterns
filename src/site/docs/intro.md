# Introduction

Welcome to **AI Agent Patterns** - a comprehensive collection of proven patterns for building AI agents that work in production environments.

## What Are AI Agent Patterns?

AI Agent Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered when building AI agents. These patterns address challenges like:

- **Resource Management**: Controlling costs and usage of expensive operations
- **Tool Coordination**: Managing multiple tools and their interactions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail or are unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing speed, accuracy, and resource usage

## Why Use Patterns?

Building AI agents involves many decisions about architecture, resource management, and user experience. Patterns provide:

- **Proven Solutions**: Battle-tested approaches that work in real applications
- **Best Practices**: Guidance on implementation and deployment
- **Multi-Library Support**: Examples across different AI frameworks
- **Production Ready**: Considerations for scalability, monitoring, and maintenance

## Getting Started

Choose your path:

1. **New to AI Agents?** Start with our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)
2. **Looking for Specific Solutions?** Browse our [Patterns Overview](./patterns/overview.md)
3. **Framework-Specific Help?** Check our [Libraries Overview](./libraries/overview.md)

## Featured Pattern: Tool Budget

The **Tool Budget Pattern** helps you control costs by implementing hard limits on expensive tool usage while maintaining agent effectiveness.

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents runaway costs in production
- Maintains functionality through graceful degradation
- Provides clear feedback to both agents and users
