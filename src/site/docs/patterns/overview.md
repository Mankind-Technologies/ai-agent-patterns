# Pattern Overview

This section contains documentation for various AI agent patterns that help solve common problems when building AI applications.

## Available Patterns

### Tool Budget
Controls tool usage with budget constraints to prevent expensive operations from exhausting resources.

### Embedded Explaining
Adds explanation requirements to tools for better observability and quality by requiring agents to justify their tool usage decisions.

### Tap Actions
Transforms opaque AI agent operations into transparent, real-time insights by intercepting, aggregating, and presenting human-readable summaries of agent activities.

### Agent Switch
Provides flat complexity scalability for categorical use cases by hiding the selection of specialized agents behind a single tool with categorical parameters.

### On-Demand Context Retrieval
Efficiently handles medium-sized documents by using a specialized agent to extract only relevant information, reducing token usage and improving performance in multi-turn conversations.
