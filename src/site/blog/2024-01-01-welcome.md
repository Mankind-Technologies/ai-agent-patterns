# Welcome to AI Agent Patterns

We're excited to launch **AI Agent Patterns** - a comprehensive collection of proven patterns for building AI agents that work in production environments.

## Why AI Agent Patterns?

Building AI agents is complex. Developers face challenges like:

- **Cost Control**: How do you prevent runaway expenses from expensive tools?
- **Reliability**: What happens when tools fail or are unavailable?
- **Performance**: How do you balance speed, accuracy, and resource usage?
- **Scalability**: How do you build agents that work at scale?

AI Agent Patterns provides battle-tested solutions to these challenges.

## What's Included

### ðŸ“š **Comprehensive Documentation**
Each pattern includes:
- Clear problem statement
- Detailed solution explanation
- Working code examples
- Real-world use cases
- Best practices and pitfalls to avoid

### ðŸ”§ **Multi-Library Support**
All patterns work across popular AI agent frameworks:
- OpenAI Agent SDK (TypeScript)
- OpenAI Agent SDK (Python)
- Pydantic AI

### ðŸš€ **Production Ready**
Every pattern is:
- Tested in real applications
- Designed for scalability
- Includes monitoring considerations
- Provides configuration options

## Featured Pattern: Tool Budget

Our first pattern, **Tool Budget**, addresses one of the most common challenges in AI agent development: controlling costs.

```typescript
import { budget } from './patterns/tool-budget';

const expensiveTool = budget(webScrapingTool, { 
  maxTimes: 3 
});

// Agent automatically learns to use the tool strategically
```

The pattern provides:
- Hard limits on expensive operations
- Clear feedback to agents and users
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached
- Strategic decision-making capabilities
